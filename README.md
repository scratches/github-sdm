# software-delivery-machine

an Atomist automation for software delivery

**GitHub Software Delivery Machine**: An Atomist reference implementation.

## What is a "Software Delivery Machine?"
A **software delivery machine** is a development process in a box. It automates all steps in the flow from commit to production (potentially via staging environments), and many other actions, using the consistent model provided by Atomist's API for software.

## Implementations of Atomist
Atomist is a flexible system, enabling you to build your own automations or use those provided by Atomist or third parties.

This repository is a *reference implementation* of Atomist, which focuses on the phases of a typical delivery flow. You can fork it and modify it as the starting point for your own Atomist implementation, or use it purely as a reference.

## Concepts
This repository shows how Atomist can automate important tasks and improve your delivery flow. Specifically:

- How Atomist command handlers can be used to create services
the right way every time, and help keep them up to date 
- How Atomist event handlers can drive and improve a custom delivery experience, from commit through 
to deployment and testing

It demonstrates Atomist as the *API for software*, exposing

- *What we know*: The Atomist cortex, accessible through GraphQL queries and subscription joins
- *What just happened*: An event, triggered by a GraphQL subscription, which is contextualized with the existing knowledge
- *What you're working on*: A library that enables you to comprehend and manipulate the source code you're working on.

Atomist is not tied to GitHub, but this repository focuses on using Atomist with GitHub.com or
GitHub Enterprise.

## Key Functionality
The following key functionality of this project will be available when you run this automation client in your team:

- *Project creation for Spring*. Atomist is not Spring specific, but we use Spring boot as an illustration here. Try `@atomist create spring`. The seed project used by default will be `spring-team/spring-rest-seed`. 
 - If you want to add or modify the content of generated projects, modify `CustomSpringBootGeneratorParameters.ts` to specify your own seed. Just about any Spring Boot project will work as the transformation of a seed project is quite forgiving, and parses the seed to find the location and name of the `@SpringBootApplication` class, rather than relying on hard coding. 
 - To perform sophisticated changes, such as dynamically computing content, modify the code in `springBootGenerator.ts`. 
- *Delivery pipeline to either Kubernetes or Pivotal Cloud Foundry for Spring Boot projects*. This includes automatic local deployment of non-default branches on the same node as the automation client. The delivery pipeline is automatically triggered on pushes.
- *Upgrading Spring Boot version* across one or many repositories. Try `@atomist try to upgrade spring boot`. This will create a branch upgrading to Spring Boot `1.5.9` and wait for the build to complete. If the build succeeds, a PR will be created; if it fails, an issue will be created linking to the failed build log and offending branch. To choose a specific Spring Boot version, or see what happens when a bogus version triggers a failure, try `@atomist try to upgrade spring boot desiredBootVersion=<version>`. If you run such a command in a channel linked to an Atomist repository, it will affect only that repository. If you run it in a channel that is not linked, it will affect all repositories by default. You can add a `targets.repos=<regex>` parameter to specify a regular expression to target a subset of repo names. For example: `@atomist try to upgrade spring boot targets.repos=test.*`.

This project builds on other Atomist core functionality available from global automations, such as:

- Atomist **lifecycle** for GitHub, showing commit, pull request and other activity through actionable messages.
- Issue handling:
	- `@atomist create issue`

Type `@atomist show skills` in any channel to see a list of all available Atomist commands.

## Structure of This Project
The exports in the `src/index.ts` file represent the public API of this repository, which is more likely than other code to remain stable. 
> In particular, the event listener interfaces discussed later in the document are expected to remain stable.

The `src/software-delivery-machine` directory contains an example of an implementation of Atomist, using the other functionality. This is the code you are most likely to change to meet your requirements.

## Events
The heart of Atomist is its event handling. As your code flows from commit
through to deployment and beyond, Atomist receives events, correlates the incoming data
with its previous knowledge, and invokes your event handlers with rich context. This enables you to perform tasks such as:

- Scanning code for security or quality issues on every push
- Driving deployments and promotion between environments

It also enables Atomist to provide you with visibility throughout the commit to deployment flow, in Slack or through the Atomist web dashboard.

Event handlers subscribe to events using GraphQL subscriptions. The following example subscribes to completed builds:

```graphql
subscription OnBuildComplete {
  Build {
    buildId
    buildUrl
    compareUrl
    name
    status
    commit {
      sha
      message
      repo {
        name
        owner
        gitHubId
        allowRebaseMerge
        channels {
          name
          id
        }
      }
      statuses {
        context
        description
        state
        targetUrl
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Given our use of typescript, an event handler can subscribe to such events with the benefit of strong typing. For example, this Atomist event handler can respond to the above GraphQL subscription:

```typescript
@EventHandler("Set status on build complete",
    GraphQL.subscriptionFromFile("graphql/subscription/OnBuildComplete.graphql"))
export class SetStatusOnBuildComplete implements HandleEvent<OnBuildComplete.Subscription> {

    public async handle(event: EventFired<OnBuildComplete.Subscription>, 
    	ctx: HandlerContext, 
    	params: this): Promise<HandlerResult> {
```

This repository
includes event handlers that subscribe to some of the most important events in a typical
delivery flow. This enables dynamic and sophisticated delivery processes that are consistent across
multiple projects.

## Core Concepts
This reference implementation has the following core concepts:

- Key phases in the delivery flow, with easy ways to respond to them
- Additional event handlers, relating to issues
- Other automations, allowing you to create new services and update existing services
- A buildable software delivery machine

## Events and Phases

The key phases handled in this repository are:

- _On repo creation_. When a new repository has been created, we often want to perform
additional actions, such as provisioning an issue tracker. We provide a hook for this
and also demonstrate how to add GitHub topics based on initial repo content.  
- _On push to a repo._ This is often a trigger for code review or other actions based on code. Specifically, we allow
   - Analysis of semantic diffs: What is the meaning of what changed?
	- Code review, including using external tools such as Checkstyle
	- Autofixes
	- Arbitrary actions on the code, such as notifying people or systems of the changes
- _On build result_
- _On image link._ A trigger for deployment.
- _On successful deployment_, as shown by a GitHub status.
- _On validation of a deployed endpoint_, as shown by a GitHub status.

## GitHub Statuses
We use the following GitHub statuses to drive our flow and show the stages:

- tbd

> The use of GitHub statuses to drive and identify stages in the flow is a choice in this implementation. It's just one strategy and the core listener interfaces are decoupled from it.

## Phases in Detail
Each of the delivery phases results in the triggering of domain specific listeners that are provided with the appropriate context to process the event: For example, access to the project source code in the case of a code review, or access to the reported URL for a deployed endpoint. Certain properties are common to all events, enabling communication with users via Slack, and providing credentials for calls to GitHub.

All listener invocations receive at least the following generally useful information:

```typescript
export interface ListenerInvocation {

    /**
     * The repo this relates to
     */
    id: RemoteRepoRef;

    /**
     * Context of the Atomist EventHandler invocation. Use to run GraphQL
     * queries, use the messageClient directly and find
     * the team and correlation id
     */
    context: HandlerContext;

    /**
     * If available, provides a way to address the channel(s) related to this repo.
     */
    addressChannels?: AddressChannels;

    /**
     * Credentials for use with source control hosts such as GitHub
     */
    credentials: ProjectOperationCredentials;

}
```

### Issue Creation
When a new issue is created, you may want to notify people or perform an action.
#### Listener interfaces
`NewIssueListener`: [NewIssueListener](src/common/listener/NewIssueListener.ts)

#### Examples
The following simple example notifies any user who raises an issue with insufficient detail in the body, via a 
direct message in Slack, and provides them with a helpful
link to the issue. Note that we make use of the
person available via the `openedBy` field:

```typescript
export async function requestDescription(inv: NewIssueInvocation) {
    if (!inv.issue.body || inv.issue.body.length < 10) {
        await inv.context.messageClient.addressUsers(
            `Please add a description for new issue ${inv.issue.number}: _${inv.issue.title}_: ${inv.id.url}/issues/${inv.issue.number}`,
            inv.issue.openedBy.person.chatId.screenName);
    }
}
```
This is registed with a `SoftwareDeliveryMachine` instance as follows:

```typescript
sdm.addNewIssueListeners(requestDescription)
```
Using the `credentials` on the `NewIssueInvocation`, you can even use the GitHub API to modify the issue, for example correctly spelling errors.

### Repo Creation
We frequently want to respond to the creation of a new repository: For example, to notify people, provision infrastructure, or tag it with GitHub topics based on its contents.

#### Listener interfaces
There are two scenarios to consider:

1. The creation of a new repository. `RepoCreationListener`: [RepoCreationListener](src/common/listener/RepoCreationListener.ts)
2. The first push to a repository, which uses the more generic [ProjectListener](src/common/listener/Listener.ts)

The second scenario is usually more important, as it is possible to create a repository without any source code or a master branch, which isn't enough to work with for common actions.

#### Examples
The following example publishes a message to the `#general` channel in Slack when a new repo has been created:

```typescript
export const PublishNewRepo: SdmListener = (i: ListenerInvocation) => {
    return i.context.messageClient.addressChannels(
        `A new repo was created: \`${i.id.owner}:${i.id.repo}\``, "general");
};

```

Tagging a repo with topics based on its content is a useful action. `tagRepo` is a convenient function to construct a `ProjectListener` for this. It tags as an argument a `Tagger`, which looks at the project content and returns a `Tags` object. The following example from `atomist.config.ts` tags Spring Boot repos, using a `Tagger` from the `spring-automation` project, in addition to suggesting the addition of a Cloud Foundry manifest, and publishing the repo using the listener previously shown:

```typescript
sdm.addNewRepoWithCodeActions(
      tagRepo(springBootTagger),
      suggestAddingCloudFoundryManifest,
      PublishNewRepo)
```

### Push
A push to the source control hosting system is typically a very important trigger for actions. The `SoftwareDeliveryMachine` divides the actions into several steps:

- Code Review
- Code

There are multiple listeners associated with pushes.

Most of the listeners use or extend `ProjectListener`, which listens to the following extension of `ListenerInvocation`:

```typescript
/**
 * Invocation for an event relating to a project for which we have source code
 */
export interface ProjectListenerInvocation extends ListenerInvocation {

    /**
     * The project to which this event relates. It will have been cloned
     * prior to this invocation. Modifications made during listener invocation will
     * not be committed back to the project (although they are acceptable if necessary, for
     * example to run particular commands against the project).
     * As well as working with
     * project files using the Project superinterface, we can use git-related
     * functionality fro the GitProject subinterface: For example to check
     * for previous shas.
     * We can also easily run shell commands against the project using its baseDir.
     */
    project: GitProject;

}
```
#### Phase Creation
The first and most important reaction to a push is determining the set of *phases* that will be executed. This will drive further behavior: For example, do we need a code review? Do we need to deploy a push to this branch. Typically phase creation depends both on the characteristics of the push (usually, its branch), and the characteristics of the repo--for example, does it have a Cloud Foundry manifest?

The `PhaseCreator` interface is thus a critical determinant of what happens next:

```typescript
export interface PhaseCreator {

    /**
     * Test the push as to whether we should even look inside it.
     * If we return false here, our createPhases method will never be
     * called for this push
     */
    guard?: PushTest;

    /**
     * Determine the phases that apply to this PhaseCreationInvocation,
     * or return undefined if this PhaseCreator doesn't know what to do with it.
     * The latter is not an error.
     * @param {PhaseCreationInvocation} pci
     * @return {Promise<Phases>}
     */
    createPhases(pci: PhaseCreationInvocation): Promise<Phases | undefined>;
}
```
Available interface is:

```typescript
export interface PhaseCreationInvocation extends ProjectListenerInvocation {

    push: OnPushToAnyBranch.Push;
}
```
If all `PhaseCreator` instances return `undefined` the commit will be tagged as "not material" and no further action will be taken.

#### Listener interfaces

##### ProjectReviewer
`ProjectReviewer` is a type defined in `automation-client-ts`. It allows a structured review to be returned. The review comments can localize the file path, line and column if such information is available, and also optionally include a link to a "fix" command to autofix the problem.

The following is a trival project reviewer that always returns a clean report but logs to the console to show when it's invoked:

```typescript
export const logReview: ProjectReviewer = async (p: GitProject,
                                                 ctx: HandlerContext) => {
    console.log("REVIEWING THING");
    return clean(p.id);
};

```

Add in `atomist.config.ts` as follows:

```typescript
sdm.addProjectReviewers(logReview)
    .addProjectReviewers(checkstyleReviewer(checkStylePath));
```
##### CodeReaction interface
This interface allows you to react to the code and changes:

For example, the following function lists changed files to any linked Slack channels for the repo:
```typescript
export async function listChangedFiles(i: CodeReactionInvocation): Promise<any> {
    return i.addressChannels(`Files changed:\n${i.filesChanged.map(n => "- `" + n + "`").join("\n")}`);
}
```
Add in `atomist.config.ts` as follows:

```typescript
sdm.addCodeReactions(listChangedFiles)
```

#### Fingerprints

## Pulling it All Together: The `SoftwareDeliveryMachine` class

Your event listeners need to be invoked by Atomist handlers. The `SoftwareDeliveryMachine` takes care of this, ensuring that the correct handlers are emitted for use in `atomist.config.ts`.

It also allows you to use a fluent builder approach to adding command handlers. generators and editors.

### Example
```typescript
const sdm = new SoftwareDeliveryMachine(
        {
            builder: K8sBuildOnSuccessStatus,
            deployers: [
                K8sStagingDeployOnSuccessStatus,
                K8sProductionDeployOnSuccessStatus,
            ],
        },
        new GuardedPhaseCreator(HttpServicePhases, PushesToDefaultBranch, IsMaven, IsSpringBoot,
            HasK8Spec,
            PushToPublicRepo),
        new GuardedPhaseCreator(LocalDeploymentPhases, not(PushFromAtomist), IsMaven, IsSpringBoot),
        new GuardedPhaseCreator(LibraryPhases, IsMaven, MaterialChangeToJavaRepo),
        new GuardedPhaseCreator(NpmPhases, IsNode),
    );
    sdm.addNewIssueListeners(requestDescription)
        .addEditors(() => tryToUpgradeSpringBootVersion)
        .addGenerators(() => springBootGenerator({
            seedOwner: "spring-team",
            seedRepo: "spring-rest-seed",
            groupId: "myco",
        }))
        .addNewRepoWithCodeActions(
            tagRepo(springBootTagger),
            suggestAddingCloudFoundryManifest,
            PublishNewRepo)
        .addProjectReviewers(logReview);
   
    sdm.addCodeReactions(listChangedFiles)
        .addFingerprinters(mavenFingerprinter)
        .addFingerprintDifferenceListeners(diff1)
        .addDeploymentListeners(PostToDeploymentsChannel)
        .addEndpointVerificationListeners(LookFor200OnEndpointRootGet)
        .addVerifiedDeploymentListeners(presentPromotionButton)
        .addSupersededListeners(
            inv => {
                logger.info("Will undeploy application %j", inv.id);
                return LocalMavenDeployer.deployer.undeploy(inv.id);
            })
        .addSupportingCommands(
            () => addCloudFoundryManifest,
            DescribeStagingAndProd,
            () => disposeProjectHandler,
        )
        .addSupportingEvents(OnDryRunBuildComplete);
```
The `SoftwareDeliveryMachine` instance will create the necessary Atomist event handlers to export.

In `atomist.config.ts` you can bring them in as follows:

```typescript
commands: assembled.commandHandlers.concat([
        // other command handlers,
    ]),
    events: assembled.eventHandlers.concat([
    		// other event handlers
    ]),
```

## Plugging in Third Party Tools

This repo shows the use of Atomist to perform many steps itself. However, each of the phases used by Atomist here is pluggable.

It's also easy to integrate third party tools like Checkstyle.

### Integrating CI tools
One of the tools you are most likely to integrate is CI. For example, you can integrate Jenkins, Travis or Circle CI with Atomist so that these tools are responsible for build. This has potential advantages in terms of scheduling and repeatability of environments.

Integrating a CI tool with Atomist is simple. Simply invoke Atomist hooks to send events around build and artifact creation.

If integrating CI tools, we recommend the following:

- CI tools are great for building and generating artifacts. They are often abused as a PaaS for `bash`. If you find your CI usage has you programming in `bash` or YML, consider whether invoking such operations from Atomist event handlers might be a better model.
- Use Atomist generators to create your CI files, and Atomist editors to keep them in synch, minimizing inconsistency.

#### Example: Integrating Travis
tbc

### Integrating APM tools

### Integrating with Static Analysis Tools
Any tool that runs on code, such as Checkstyle, can easily be integrated.

Use shell. node is good for this

## Running this Project

### Binary Dependencies
To start up these project, you will need the following on the deployment node:

- `git` binary
- JDK, for Maven and Checkstyle
- Maven, with `mvn` on the path


### Environment Variables

- `ATOMIST_WORKSPACE`: The Atomist workspace this automation will serve. For example, `export ATOMIST_WORKSPACE="T5964N9B7"`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Most of the GitHub access occurs with user credentials. However,
one or two checks occur when they are not available, and a GitHub token must be supplied.

For the optional Checkstyle integration to work, set up a Checkstyle environment variable as follows:

```
# Path to checkstyle JAR
export CHECKSTYLE_PATH="/Users/rodjohnson/tools/checkstyle-8.8/checkstyle-8.8-all.jar"
```

Get checkstyle-8.8-all.jar from [Checkstyle's download page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/checkstyle/files/checkstyle/8.8/).
